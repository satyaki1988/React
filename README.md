After that you will need install react framework to your local system using npm.

# To install react framework please type the follwing command line from your Windows system -

# You can also install yarn ( which is another package manager tool, jut like npm), yarn is only available within react. To install we will need npm
npm i -g yarn

# once the installation done, you can create react project using that-
create-react-app project-name

# move to you project folder by typing 
cd project-name

# then you can add third party libraries either using npm or yarn. Here I am giving an example of bootstrap -
